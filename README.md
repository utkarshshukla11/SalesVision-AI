# SalesVision-AI

## 📌 Project Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave, helping HR teams take action to retain valuable talent.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
- Hiring and keeping employees is challenging — it costs time, money, and effort.
- Small business owners spend nearly 40% of their working hours on non-revenue tasks like hiring.
- Companies spend 15–20% of a new employee's salary just to recruit them.
- Hiring takes an average of 52 days, and companies can lose 1–2.5% of total revenue during onboarding.

By predicting attrition, organizations can save costs, improve productivity, and retain top talent.

<b style="color:#34495e;">Problem Statement</b>
Sales forecasting is one of the most critical challenges faced by retail companies. Relying on intuition or simple averages often leads to poor decisions. Predictive models, on the other hand, can:
Learn from 1115 stores’ historical data
Incorporate seasonality patterns, holidays, promotions, and competition
Help businesses prepare in advance for demand fluctuations

<b style="color:#34495e;">Inputs & Features Used</b>
My act as a <b>data scientist</b> in a company. The HR team provides employee data and asks me to build a model to predict which employees are more likely to leave.

<b style="color:#34495e;">The dataset includes a wide range of features impacting sales:</b>
Transaction ID: Combination of Store and Date
Store ID: Unique identifier for each store
Sales: Target variable (daily sales)
Customers: Number of daily visitors
Open: Whether the store was open or closed
Promo: Indicates if a store ran a promotion
StateHoliday: Public holiday type (Easter, Christmas, etc.)
SchoolHoliday: Whether public schools were closed
StoreType: Type of store (basic, extra, extended)
Assortment: Level of product variety
CompetitionDistance: Distance to nearest competitor
CompetitionOpenSince: Date when competitor opened
Promo2 & Promo2Since: Continuing or interval-based promotions
    
<b style="color:#34495e;">Outcome:</b>
✅ Build a robust predictive model to forecast daily sales.
✅ Help the sales department improve planning and strategy.
✅ Enable targeted promotions and optimize resource allocation.
✅ Strengthen customer satisfaction by ensuring demand is met effectively.
