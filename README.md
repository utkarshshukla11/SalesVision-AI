Sales forecasting is one of the most critical challenges faced by retail companies. Relying on intuition or simple averages often leads to poor decisions. Predictive models, on the other hand, can:
Learn from 1115 stores‚Äô historical data
Incorporate seasonality patterns, holidays, promotions, and competition
Help businesses prepare in advance for demand fluctuations

My act as a <b>data scientist</b> in a company. The HR team provides employee data and asks me to build a model to predict which employees are more likely to leave.

<b style="color:#34495e;">The dataset includes a wide range of features impacting sales:</b><br>
Transaction ID: Combination of Store and Date
Store ID: Unique identifier for each store
